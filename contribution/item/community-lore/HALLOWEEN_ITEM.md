An actual pumpkin, carved with a scary face. For some reason, they pop up all over the city, every year for the entire month of october.
Nobody knows who or what makes them, how they are spread literally all over the place, how they don't go bad until the first day of november...
It's almost like a creeptastic halloween miracle!
