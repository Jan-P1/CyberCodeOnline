**Trash Boots Cache**.

They say one man's trash is another man's treasureâ€¦ 

This cache holds the information for printing shoes of the absolutely lowest quality. Probably. This kind of cache seems to corrupt all too often.

The shoes this prints are definitely not ideal. They never seem to fit properly. Sometimes they print as a shoe-shaped fabric-blobs.
Some people even claim they got blisters from just putting the printed shoes on! The manufacturer however claims faulty printing material was at fault and that they are all just rumors...

You are likely better off wrapping your feet in bandages or old, worn t-shirts. However, it's better than nothing, right?...
